              <h4>
                A dedicated Front-end Developer <br /> based in Kerala üìç
              </h4>
              <p>
                I completed my Bachelor of Engineering in Civil from Dhirajlal
                Gandhi College Of Technology.
              </p>
              <br />

              <p>
                My engineering background equips me with problem-solving,
                attention to detail, and project management skills, all valuable
                in web development, where precise user experience and project
                management are crucial.
              </p>
              <br />

              <p>
                My goal is to combine my engineering background with my newfound
                interest in web development to make websites that are
                user-friendly. It's a bit of a change from what I was doing
                before, but I'm excited to see where this journey takes me.
